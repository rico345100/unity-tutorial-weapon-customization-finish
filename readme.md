## How to open?
I used Unity 2019.1.0f2 to create this project. You can try open with different version but that's not recommended.
At least try with 2019.x.


## Can I use this in my project?
Sure, of course! All the resources in this package is commercial free and CC0. But if you can, leave the comment in the sound authors!
